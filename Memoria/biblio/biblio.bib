abstract = {Oxygen mass transfer in sparged stirred tank bioreactors has been studied. The rate of oxygen mass transfer into a culture in a bioreactor is affected by operational conditions and geometrical parameters as well as the physicochemical properties of the medium (nutrients, substances excreted by the micro-organism, and surface active agents that are often added to the medium) and the presence of the micro-organism. Thus, oxygen mass transfer coefficient values in fermentation broths often differ substantially from values estimated for simple aqueous solutions. The influence of liquid phase physicochemical properties on kLa must be divided into the influence on k(L) and a, because they are affected in different ways. The presence of micro-organisms (cells, bacteria, or yeasts) can affect the mass transfer rate, and thus kLa values, due to the consumption of oxygen for both cell growth and metabolite production. In this work, theoretical equations for kLa prediction, developed for sparged and stirred tanks, taking into account the possible oxygen mass transfer enhancement due to the consumption by biochemical reactions, are proposed. The estimation of kLa is carried out taking into account a strong increase of viscosity broth, changes in surface tension and different oxygen uptake rates (OURs), and the biological enhancement factor, E, is also estimated. These different operational conditions and changes in several variables are performed using different systems and cultures (xanthan aqueous solutions, xanthan production cultures by Xanthomonas campestris, sophorolipids production by Candida bombicola, etc.). Experimental and theoretical results are presented and compared, with very good results.},

abstract = {The physical mechanisms underlying bubble formation from a needle in a co-flowing liquid environment at high Reynolds numbers are studied in detail with the aid of experiments and boundary-integral numerical simulations. To determine the effect of gas inertia the experiments were carried out with air and helium. The influence of the injection system is elucidated by performing experiments using two different facilities, one where the constancy of the gas flow-rate entering the bubble is ensured, and another one where the gas is injected through a needle directly connected to a pressurized chamber. In the case of constant flow-rate injection conditions, the bubbling frequency has been shown to hardly depend on the gas density, with a bubble size given by db/ro 6U(kU+k2)/(U1)1/3 for U2, where U is the gas-to-liquid ratio of the mean velocities, ro is the radius of the gas injection needle, and k = 5.84 and k2 = 4.29, with db/ro 3.3U1/3 for U1. Nevertheless, in this case the effect of gas density is relevant to describe the final instants of bubble breakup, which take place at a time scale much smaller than the bubbling time, tb. This effect is evidenced by the liquid jets penetrating the gas bubbles upon their pinch-off. Our measurements indicate that the velocity of the penetrating jets is considerably larger in air bubbles than in helium bubbles due to the distinct gas inertia of both situations. However, in the case of constant pressure supply conditions, the bubble size strongly depends on the density of the gas through the pressure loss along the gas injection needle. Furthermore, under the operating conditions reported here, the equivalent diameters of the bubbles are between 10{\%} and 20{\%} larger than their constant flow-rate counterparts. In addition, the experiments and the numerical results show that, under constant pressure supply, helium bubbles are approximately 10{\%} larger than air bubbles due to the gas density effect on the bubbling process.},

abstract = {A prediction method for calculating the volumetric mass transfer coefficient, kLa, in gas-liquid sparged stirred tanks is proposed. A theoretical equation based on Hibie's penetration theory and the isotropic turbulence theory of Kolmogoroff is used for kL determination. The values of the interfacial area have been calculated from a hold-up theoretical equation and the mean size of the gas bubble. Both Ostwald-De Waele and Casson models are used to describe the rheological properties of the fluid. The model predicts the mass transfer coefficient and the interfacial area values in stirred tank reactors, analysing the influence of different variables. The values of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient can be calculated for different geometries of the reactor, different physicochemical properties of the liquid and under different operational conditions. The capability of prediction has been examined using experimental data available in the literature for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, for very different vessel sizes, different numbers and types of stirrers and a wide range of operational conditions, with very good results. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {sWater is vital for sustaining all forms of life on earth. Treatment of domestic wastewater before its disposal into the environment was not given much importance until the recent past. This was due to increased contamination rates of surface and ground water sources. Domestic wastewater treatment is becoming even more critical due to diminishing water resources and resulting water scarcity especially during summer in many parts of the country. Aeration is one of the methods which help in the removal of various contaminants present in domestic wastewater. This paper focuses on how the various constituents of waste water vary with aeration. Diffused fine bubble aeration was done in a circular tank at various flow rates (1.5 L/minute, 3 L/minute, 4 L/minute) at time periods of 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours using air stones and the percentage reduction in COD, BOD and Turbidity were found out. It was found that as flow rate of aeration increased the percentage removal of above constituents also increased. Optimum removal was possible at a flow rate of 4 L/min at time period of 72 hours. BOD, COD, Turbidity were found to be removed by 95.88{\%}, 95.71{\%}, and 37.72{\%} respectively.},

abstract = {Supercritical water possesses a number of important characteristics that make it suitable for oxidation, synthesis and gasification reactions. It is especially ad-vantageous for very wet biomass whose gasification in this medium avoids the large expense of energy required for drying. Although the process is in labo-ratory scale it has a great potential for production of hydrogen and other gases from biomass. This paper reviews the present state of the art and summarizes major observations arrived at in small scale laboratory flow and batch reactors. Effects of operating parameters like, pressure, temperature, etc., on the yield and conversion are discussed. Catalysts appear to play an important role in increas-ing the conversion rate and decreasing the reaction temperature for gasification. Heat recovery from the product stream holds key to making the gasification pro-cess auto-thermal. Heat exchanger efficiency, therefore, plays an important role in this process. Several investigators have used the equilibrium model and exergy analysis for thermodynamic analysis of supercritical gasification plants. Energy efficiency of such a plant could be around 50{\%}.},

abstract = {Aeration is the most energy-intensive operation in wastewater treatment, amounting to 45-75{\%} of plant energy costs. Fine-pore diffusers are today almost ubiquitous in municipal wastewater aeration, due to their advantageous aeration efficiency (mass of oxygen transferred per unit energy required). Nevertheless, older municipal treatment facilities and many industrial treatment plants are still equipped with coarse-bubble or surface aerators. Fine-pore diffusers are subject to two major disadvantages: a) fouling, if not cleaned periodically; b) decrease in oxygen transfer efficiency caused by dissolved surfactants. Coarse-bubble and surface aerators are typically not subject to the traditional problems affecting fine-pore diffusers. Nonetheless, they achieve oxygen transfer at the expense of increased energy intensity. The increased biomass concentration associated with high mean cell retention time (MCRT) operations has a beneficial effect on aeration. Nutrient-removing selectors are able to further increase aeration efficiency, as they sorb and utilize the readily available substrate which otherwise would accumulate at bubble surfaces and dramatically decrease aeration efficiency. We summarise here our 30-year long experience in aeration research, and results obtained with clean-and process-water tests are used to show the beneficial effects of high MCRT operations, the beneficial effect of selectors, and the decline of aeration efficiency due to dissolved surfactants.},

abstract = {We utilize numerical solutions, based on a boundary-integral scheme, to investigate the mechanisms by which surfactant influences the coalescence of a pair of equal size drops that undergo a head-on collision in a biaxial linear flow. It is known that the addition of surfactant inhibits coalescence in the sense that the time required for film drainage to the point of film rupture is significantly increased. Although there is a direct effect on the rate of film drainage due to Marangoni effects within the thin film, we find that an equally important effect is due to the fact that the hydrodynamic force pushing the drops together is increased, hence causing the film to be more strongly deformed into a dimpled configuration that slows the film drainage process.},

abstract = {Dynamics of formation of a drop of an incompressible Newtonian fluid of viscosity $\mu$1 and density $\rho$1 from the tip of a tube of radius R1 into a co-flowing immiscible, incompressible Newtonian fluid of viscosity $\mu$2 and density $\rho$2 that is enclosed in a concentric cylindrical tube of radius R2 are investigated under creeping flow conditions. Transient drop shapes, and fluid velocities and pressures, are calculated numerically by solving the governing Stokes equations with the appropriate boundary and initial conditions using the Galerkin/ finite element method for spatial discretization and an adaptive finite difference method for time integration. In accord with previous studies, the primary effect of increasing the ratio of the volumetric injection rate Q2 of the outer fluid to that of the inner fluid Q1, QrQ2/ Q1, is shown to be a reduction in the volume of primary drops that are formed. When Qr is small, calculations show that drop formation occurs in a slug flow regime where the primary drops that are about to be formed are elongated axially and occupy virtually the entire cross section of the outer tube. In this slug flow regime, the primary drops at breakup resemble cylinders that are terminated by hemispherical caps and their aspect ratios Lp/ Dp1, where Lp denotes their axial lengths and Dp2R2 their maximum diameters. As Qr increases, the dynamics are shown to transition to the dripping regime, where the primary drops are more globular, Lp/Dp 1, and their radii are of the order of or smaller than R1. As Qr increases, the importance of viscous stress exerted by the outer fluid relative to the surface tension or capillary pressure increases. Thus, the drop length measured from the tube exit to the drop tip at breakup increases while the primary drop volume decreases as Qr increases. When Qr is sufficiently large, viscous stress exerted by the outer fluid induces a recirculating flow within a forming drop. Once Qr exceeds a critical value Qrt, viscous stress exerted by the outer fluid becomes so large that the growing drop takes on a conical shape and a thin fluid jet with a radius that is a few orders of magnitude smaller than that of the radius of the inner tube emanates from its tip. This latter regime of drop breakup, which is henceforward referred to as tip streaming, is remarkably similar to electrohydrodynamic jetting that is seen from the tips of conical drops in electric fields and tip streaming that occurs from the pointed ends of surfactant-covered free drops subjected to linear extensional or shear flows, but takes place here in the absence of electric fields or surfactants. Scaling arguments for fixed aR2/R1 show that for exterior viscous stress to overcome capillary pressure and cause tip streaming, Ca-1{\textless}mQr, where Ca$\mu$1 Q1/$\gamma$$\pi$R12 is the capillary number, $\gamma$ is the interfacial tension, and m$\mu$2/$\mu$1 is the viscosity ratio. In accordance with the scaling arguments, the computed predictions show that the critical value of the flow rate ratio signaling transition from dripping to tip streaming Qrt varies inversely with m for small to moderate m but becomes independent of both Ca and m as viscosity ratio grows without bound. 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

The analysis, which is supported by an exhaustive experimental study in which the liquid viscosity is varied by three orders of magnitude, provides closed expressions for both the bubbling frequencies and the bubble diameters. Different equations are obtained depending on the values of the three dimensionless parameters characterizing this physical situation, namely the Weber and Reynolds numbers and the gas to liquid flow rate ratio. Since both the inertia dominated and viscous dominated bubbling regimes are simply described in terms of the local pressure gradient and the flow rate ratio, the same types of ideas can be applied in the design of bubble makers in which the pressure gradients are controlled in completely different ways.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {In this work the effect of surfactants on the coalescence of a drop with a flat aqueous-organic interface was experimentally investigated. A high speed Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system was used to obtain velocity profiles and kinetic energy per unit mass distribution inside the coalescing droplets. Different mass ratios of surfactant to oil below the CMC value, up to ϕ = 5 × 10−4, of a non-ionic surfactant dissolved in the organic phase were studied. It was found that an increase in the surfactant concentration promoted the deformation of the interface before the film that separated the drop from the interface ruptured. A high surfactant concentration also increased the time needed for film rupture. When rupture occurred, two counter-rotating vortices formed inside the droplet on either side of the rupture point, which moved upwards with time. The propagation of the vortices inside the droplet was faster for low surfactant concentrations, while the intensities of the two counter-rotating vortices significantly decreased for increasing surfactant concentration. At the early stages of coalescence after film rupture, the kinetic energy per unit mass was mainly distributed near the bottom part of the droplet, while at later stages it was distributed near the upper part of the droplet.},

abstract = {In large-scale waste water treatment plants, the aerobic biochemical reactor is the most important process, where the oxygen supply into the microorganisms often limits the overall waste water treatment rate. On the other hand, several kinds of microbubble distributors have been developed to enrich the oxygen dissolution in water. Therefore, the application of microbubbles for a waste water treatment system was investigated in this study. The oxygen absorption performance of typical microbubble generators was compared with typical bubble generators. To evaluate each bubble generator, the liquid-phase volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient, gas hold-up and power consumption per unit liquid volume were measured in a bubble column attached to each bubble generator. All the microbubble generators allowed the oxygen to dissolve faster than the typical aerators. The spiral liquid flow type microbubble generator had the highest oxygen transfer coefficient even at a low air flow rate although it used more energy than the typical distributors. To improve an industrial waste water treatment system, a novel aeration system utilizing a spiral liquid flow type microbubble generator was proposed in this study. The present system has some advantages such as compact size, portability and fast oxygen dissolution rate. To ensure the performance for organic waste water treatment, the effects of the aeration rate, dissolved oxygen concentration and device properties on the specific consumption rate of model organic waste were investigated. For the novel aeration system, the most suitable conditions to treat organic waste were found. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Jets, i.e. collimated streams of matter, occur from the microscale up to the large-scale structure of the universe. Our focus will be mostly on surface tension effects, which result from the cohesive properties of liquids. Paradoxically, cohesive forces promote the breakup of jets, widely encountered in nature, technology and basic science, for example in nuclear fission, DNA sampling, medical diagnostics, sprays, agricultural irrigation and jet engine technology. Liquid jets thus serve as a paradigm for free-surface motion, hydrodynamic instability and singularity formation leading to drop breakup. In addition to their practical usefulness, jets are an ideal probe for liquid properties, such as surface tension, viscosity or non-Newtonian rheology. They also arise from the last but one topology change of liquid masses bursting into sprays. Jet dynamics are sensitive to the turbulent or thermal excitation of the fluid, as well as to the surrounding gas or fluid medium. The aim of this review is to provide a unified description of the fundamental and the technological aspects of these subjects.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a detailed experimental study of the periodic formation of bubbles in an air–water coflowing stream, as well as a simple model to describe the process. The frequency of formation of bubbles was measured analysing a large number of images recorded with a high-speed camera for a wide range of experimental conditions and air-injection needle geometries. The analysis of the images indicated that the bubble-formation process consisted of two distinct stages, namely the ligament expansion stage, characterized by the radial growth of an air ligament left attached to the injection needle after the pinch-off of a bubble, and the ligament collapse stage, characterized by the formation of a neck at the tip of the injection needle which propagates downstream, at a velocity which is nearly the liquid velocity, until it collapses generating a new bubble. A simplified model, based on the Rayleigh–Plesset equation for a cylindrical geometry to determine the dynamics of the liquid stream and on Bernoulli's equation to determine the air pressure near the neck, has been proposed to estimate the duration of the ligament collapse stage, {\$}t{\_}{\{}col{\}}{\$}. The experimental bubble-formation frequency, properly scaled with the breakup time given by the model, is shown to collapse onto the same curve for all the experimental conditions used here, indicating that our simple model seems to retain the main physical aspects of the process.},

abstract = {The use of microbubble contrast agents for general tissue delineation and perfusion enjoys steady interest in ultrasound imaging. Microbubbles as contrast materials require a small dosage and show excellent detection sensitivity. Targeting ligands on the surface of microbubbles permit the selective accumulation of these particles in the areas of interest, which show an up-regulated level of receptor molecules on vascular endothelium. Selective contrast imaging of inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion injury, angiogenesis, and thrombosis has been achieved in animal models. Ultrasound-assisted drug delivery and activation, performed by combining microbubble agent containing drug substances or coadministered with pharmaceutical agents (including plasmid DNA for transfection), has been achieved in multiple model systems in vitro and in vivo. Ultrasound and microbubbles-based targeted acceleration of the thrombolytic enzyme action already have reached clinical trials. Overall, microbubble targeting and ultrasound-assisted microbubble-based drug-delivery systems will offer a step toward the application of targeted personalized diagnostics and therapy.},

abstract = {The effect of air flow rate on oxygen transfer efficiency was examined in clean water and under process conditions in an oxidation ditch equipped with fine bubble membrane diffusers and large blade slow speed mixers. Under process conditions, an increase in the air flow rate resulted in a decrease of the oxygen transfer efficiency similar to that observed in clean water. Consequently, the value of the alpha factor was in the order of 0.58 independently of the air flow rate (between 45 and 110 m3 h-1 per m2 of membrane). The combined influence of the air flow rate and of the horizontal liquid velocity on the oxygen transfer efficiency was studied. Results have evidenced that regrouping the diffuser grids and applying a horizontal flow could lead to a significant limitation in the impact of the air flow rate on the oxygen transfer efficiency. Finally, the use of the off gas method to determine the oxygen transfer efficiency of an aeration system at a given air flow rate led to the definition of a relationship, that enabled the evaluation of the system oxygenation capacities at air flow rates different from the one at which the measurements were initially performed.

@article{Garcia-Ochoa2009,
abstract = {In aerobic bioprocesses, oxygen is a key substrate; due to its low solubility in broths (aqueous solutions), a continuous supply is needed. The oxygen transfer rate (OTR) must be known, and if possible predicted to achieve an optimum design operation and scale-up of bioreactors. Many studies have been conducted to enhance the efficiency of oxygen transfer. The dissolved oxygen concentration in a suspension of aerobic microorganisms depends on the rate of oxygen transfer from the gas phase to the liquid, on the rate at which oxygen is transported into the cells (where it is consumed), and on the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) by the microorganism for growth, maintenance and production. The gas-liquid mass transfer in a bioprocess is strongly influenced by the hydrodynamic conditions in the bioreactors. These conditions are known to be a function of energy dissipation that depends on the operational conditions, the physicochemical properties of the culture, the geometrical parameters of the bioreactor and also on the presence of oxygen consuming cells. Stirred tank and bubble column (of various types) bioreactors are widely used in a large variety of bioprocesses (such as aerobic fermentation and biological wastewater treatments, among others). Stirred tanks bioreactors provide high values of mass and heat transfer rates and excellent mixing. In these systems, a high number of variables affect the mass transfer and mixing, but the most important among them are stirrer speed, type and number of stirrers and gas flow rate used. In bubble columns and airlifts, the low-shear environment compared to the stirred tanks has enabled successful cultivation of shear sensitive and filamentous cells. Oxygen transfer is often the rate-limiting step in the aerobic bioprocess due to the low solubility of oxygen in the medium. The correct measurement and/or prediction of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient, (k(L)a), is a crucial step in the design, operation and scale-up of bioreactors. The present work is aimed at the reviewing of the oxygen transfer rate (OTR) in bioprocesses to provide a better knowledge about the selection, design, scale-up and development of bioreactors. First, the most used measuring methods are revised; then the main empirical equations, including those using dimensionless numbers, are considered. The possible increasing on OTR due to the oxygen consumption by the cells is taken into account through the use of the biological enhancement factor. Theoretical predictions of both the volumetric mass transfer coefficient and the enhancement factor that have been recently proposed are described; finally, different criteria for bioreactor scale-up are considered in the light of the influence of OTR and OUR affecting the dissolved oxygen concentration in real bioprocess.},

These devices are then classified according to the way the bubbling process is controlled: outer liquid flows (e.g., coflows, cross flows, and flow-focusing flows), acoustic forcing, and electric fields. We also address modern techniques developed to produce bubbles coated with surfactants and liquid shells. The stringent requirements to precisely control the bubbling frequency, the bubble size, and the properties of the coating make microfluidics the natural choice to implement such techniques.},
